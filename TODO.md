## TODO
- [x] make necessary MCP work (playwright for web ui access, context7 for docs)
- [ ] set up hooks for linting
- [x] set up custom slash command `/tech_specs` and `/feature_specs`
- [ ] change the content inside `/tech_specs` and `/feature_specs` to make it more suitable for custom slash. make sure they look for information written in `/squad` dir
- [ ] i need a `/next_todo` kinda thing. i have cold starts when working on this project, maybe that will make cold starts disappears, like a jira/linear always reminding you what's the next specific coding task to do next.
- [ ] maybe add a namespace `squad` to all these commands
- [ ] implement lint and notifier hook https://chatgpt.com/share/6873341a-a0bc-800c-b257-76c0b7ad5767
- [ ] set up the universal claude.md and custom slash command inspired by [this dude](https://github.com/Veraticus/nix-config/tree/main/home-manager/claude-code)
- [ ] look at the wechat docs on the tone i should set for claude for inspiration

## future plan

- [ ] add context7 mcp usage into claude.md
