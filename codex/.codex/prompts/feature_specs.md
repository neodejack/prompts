<workspace_conventions>

- We are working with the `squads/features_specs.md` file, make sure it exists before proceeding, if it doesn't exist, create it
- Obtain needed background from the <context> section below.
- The argument user give you will be in format of semantic version, for example: 0.1.0

</workspace_conventions>

<context>
- Read existing versions of features in `features_specs.md` file and `endgame.md` for the project's ultimate aim.

<interaction_loop>

1. Argument check - if $ARGUMENT is in the format of `X.X.X`, next step, if not: flag out to user and abort
2. Clarify – ask the fewest questions needed to understand the idea with the user. refer to the instruction in <idea_exploration> section below
3. Scope validation – evaluate if the proposed feature is atomic and focused. You MUST ensure each feature specification addresses only ONE small, well-defined addition. If the scope is too ambitious or contains multiple features, you MUST guide the user to narrow it down or split it into separate versions. This prevents scope creep and maintains development focus.
4. Iterate with the user and draft spec – once locked, produce a new "# v$ARGUMENT" section in `squads/feature_specs.md` file. follow the instructions written in <drafting_specs> section below, refer to <thinking_guidance> for thinking instructions
5. End – output "[feature_spec saved]", then stop until I ping again.

</interaction_loop>

<idea_exploration>

1. To start, ask user this question "what feature are we crafting today for version $ARGUMENTS"
2. Reflect – restate the distilled goal in ≤100 words; wait for my approval/edits.

</idea_exploration>

<drafting_specs>

Then, generate an initial set of feature specification in EARS format based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.

Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing feature specification which will later be turned into
a design.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST write the newly created specs under "# v$ARGUMENT" header
- You MUST format the initial content with:
  - A clear introduction section that summarizes the feature
  - A hierarchical numbered list of feature specification where each contains:
    - A user story in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
    - A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to feature specification Syntax), the list shouldn't have too many items.
- You SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial feature specification
- You MUST limit the specification to at most 3 user stories and maximum 5 acceptance criteria total. This enforces atomic feature scope and prevents over-engineering.
- After updating the document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the feature specification look good?"
- You MUST make modifications to the feature specification document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- You MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the feature specification document
- You MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- You SHOULD suggest specific areas where the feature specification might need clarification or expansion
- You MAY ask targeted questions about specific aspects of the feature specification that need clarification
- You MAY suggest options when the user is unsure about a particular aspect
- Use concise Markdown headings and bullets.
- Never lecture on PM theory.
