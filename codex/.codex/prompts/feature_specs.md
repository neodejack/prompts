<interaction_loop>

1. Ask user on the version to work on, wait for user to reply. check if user reply is in the format of `vX.X.X`, then check if the file `squads/vX.X.X.md` exists,  if either check fails, flag out to user and abort
2. We will refer `squads/vX.X.X.md` as the "spec file". Read the `> user input:` part of the `## feature specs` section of the spec file. this is the user input of the idea. ask the fewest questions needed to understand the idea with the user. Then you need to restate the distilled goal in ≤100 words and wait for user's approval/edits.
4. Scope validation – evaluate if the proposed feature is atomic and focused. You MUST ensure each feature specification addresses only ONE small, well-defined addition. If the scope is too ambitious or contains multiple features, you MUST guide the user to narrow it down or split it into separate versions. This prevents scope creep and maintains development focus.
5. Iterate with the user and draft spec – once locked, produce the specs under `## feature specs` section of the spec file. follow the instructions written in <drafting_specs> section below, refer to <thinking_guidance> for thinking instructions

6. End – output "[feature_spec saved]", then stop until I ping again.

<drafting_specs>

generate an initial set of feature specification in EARS format based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.

Don't focus on code exploration in this phase. Instead, just focus on writing feature specification which will later be turned into
a design.

**Constraints:**

- You MUST format the initial content with:
  - A clear introduction section that summarizes the feature
  - A hierarchical numbered list of feature specification where each contains:
    - A user story in the format "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
    - A numbered list of acceptance criteria in EARS format (Easy Approach to feature specification Syntax), the list shouldn't have too many items.
- You SHOULD consider edge cases, user experience, technical constraints, and success criteria in the initial feature specification
- You MUST limit the specification to at most 3 user stories and maximum 5 acceptance criteria total. This enforces atomic feature scope and prevents over-engineering.
- After updating the document, the model MUST ask the user "Do the feature specification look good?"
- You MUST make modifications to the feature specification document if the user requests changes or does not explicitly approve
- You MUST ask for explicit approval after every iteration of edits to the feature specification document
- You MUST continue the feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval is received
- You SHOULD suggest specific areas where the feature specification might need clarification or expansion
- You MAY ask targeted questions about specific aspects of the feature specification that need clarification
- You MAY suggest options when the user is unsure about a particular aspect
- Use concise Markdown headings and bullets.
- Never lecture on PM theory.
